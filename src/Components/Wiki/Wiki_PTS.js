          <p>
            The aim of this survey is to collect information about the public
            transport usage and/or satisfaction with given public transport
            station in a city without asking any personal information (e.g.
            Name, Phone numbers, etc.) and locations of the users. The purpose
            of the survey is to understand the travel behaviour and user
            preferences.
          </p>

          <p>
            The most common questions asked in Public Transport surveys are
            about:
            <ul>
              <li>Origin and Destination details (both access and egress)</li>
              <li>Average time taken in each leg of the journey</li>
              <li>Average travel cost</li>
              <li>Trip purpose</li>
              <li>Age of the respondent</li>
              <li>Occupation of the respondents</li>
              <li>Users' preferences</li>
            </ul>
          </p>

          <p>
            The collected data will be utilized to:
            <ul>
              <li>
                Estimate the efficiency of the existing transport services
              </li>
              <li>
                Adopt policies/strategies which appeals to the need of the
                transport users or potential users
              </li>
              <li>Monitor pre and post implementation effect of initiatives</li>
            </ul>
          </p>

            (Travel Survey as a Service) serves as an inventory of travel
            information. The state-of-the-art techniques such as pen-paper
            surveys are not only time and resource-intensive, but prone to
            various errors. Some of the advanced techniques force users to
            install the app on their smartphones and continuously track their
            location throughout the day/week. Since such applications record the
            personal information and locations precisely, the response rate is
            very low due to privacy concerns. Therefore, after a fair trade-off
            between the two techniques, TSaaS is developed which is an
            open-source, web-based revealed preference survey. The survey is
            designed in a way that it records most of the information required
            to differentiate the trip profiles and trip patterns in minimum
            time, however without asking any personal information. The source
            code is hosted on GitHub as front-end and back-end.
