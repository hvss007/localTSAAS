          <h4>Aim:</h4>
          <p>
            The aim of this survey is to build a tool to collect the trip
            diaries conveniently without asking any personal information and
            locations of the users. A typical trip diary attempts to answer the
            following questions:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>How many trips do people make per day?</li>
            <li>What is the detaination?</li>
            <li>Which is the preferred travel mode?</li>
            <li>What is the preferred departure time?</li>
            <li>What is the activity/trip-sequence?</li>
            <li>
              What is the most influencing factor for their choices about travel
              mode, route etc.?
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            The collected data will be used to analyze the current trip profiles
            and travel behaviour of the residents of a city. The data is
            generally used to develop/synthesize a transportation planning model
            so that transport analysts can make predictions about the people who
            are not surveyed. The model is important to forecast the traffic, to
            test various policies etc. The implications from the policy testing
            will assist transportation planners and policy makers who need
            comprehensive data for managing the city traffic and infrastructure.

            (Travel Survey as a Service) serves as an inventory of daily trip
            diaries. The state-of-the-art techniques such as pen-paper surveys
            are not only time and resource-intensive, but prone to various
            errors. Some of the advanced techniques force users to install the
            app on their smartphones and continuously track their location
            throughout the day/week. Since such applications record the personal
            information and locations precisely, the response rate is very low
            due to privacy concerns. Therefore, after a fair trade-off between
            the two techniques, TSaaS is developed which is an open-source,
            web-based revealed preference survey. The survey is designed in a
            way that it records most of the information required to
            differentiate the trip profiles and trip patterns in minimum time,
            however without asking any personal information. The source code is
            hosted on GitHub as front-end and back-end.

            Afterwards, the model can be used to test various policies in a
            city. Some examples of the policies are: alteration/re-circulation
            in the existing network, need of a new transit line or new
            infrastructure, impacts of a new bus/metro line, optimal locations
            of smart parking systems, environmental impacts of the travel
            choices, sustainable transport modes, impact of land-use on trip

            TSaaS is looking forward to transform the current program into a
            more robust travel data gathering platform by introducing other
            travel surveys. Please contact us if you have any suggestions
